        <p id="second"> LGBTQIA+ individuals use different terms in order to identify themselves. They are also known to use different pronouns based on what they are comfortable with. This community has been facing and is currently facing different obstacles. Each member is facing discrimination and multiple stereotypes which makes them silent. However, with one another's arms, they are able to find comfort as they know that they are with someone who knows the true struggle of an LGBTQIA+ person. They are continiously fighting for their rights and for the acceptance of the world. </p>
