    <p> The transition, or more figuratively may also be called as the metamorphosis of the LGBTQIA+ community is truly beautiful. It perfectly represents the members of the community and their struggle in order to obtain the respect and the rights that they are entitled to as human beings. Moreover, this "transitional period" paved the way in order for our eyes to be opened to the naked truth that each one is equal and limiting our lenses to what we want to see and believe is not humane. </p>
     
    <br> 

    <p> People may ask though, what was there to transition from? Well, many from our generation now many not be alive to witness it first-hand, but the society back in the day, did not accept the LGBTQIA+ community for who they are. The people needed to hide their true identities in order to prevent themselves from being harshly judged by the eyes of society. At the same time, there were people back in the day, who openly talk about how disgusting this community is. Many truly despised the community and never approved of what the members of the LGBTQIA+ community were fighting for. </p>
    
    <br> 

    <p> Comparing that to now's more inclusive society, we have truly come so far in our preferences and perspectives. We have a wider scope of everything now and that is what's important. Now, we still get to speak freely and even easily due to the aid of technology. However, we have clear boundaries of when our rights end and what we get to say. Our rights end when we step over someone else's rights, regardless of their sexual preferences. We have become more open-minded and we have built a loving society from the efforts of the people who were judged so harshly and easily in the past. Now that we advance to the future, we must continue the work that we have already made in making sure that our world becomes a better place for everyone living in it. </p>
